#Upcoming Plans and Features

This is a place where I will put feature update plans! You can open an discussion in the ideas section and suggest a feature!
I will look at all of them and if I like the idea, it will be added to the plugin in an upcoming update.
The point of this is so people have the opportunity to suggest ideas and opinions that will be heard.

Disclamer - not all feature requests will be added. I dont have the time or resources to do this full time. This doesn't
mean it isnt a priority. I will of course work on this a lot on the weekends to try and make everything the best
I can make it. I also have school lol so I can't work on it all the time

| Plans 0.1.3 | Completed |
| ----- | --------- |
| fix water damage multiplier | In progress |
| /origins reload command | Todo |
| orb of origins recipe | Todo |

hey cool idea, custom inventory menu without creating a custom one with a name at the top, use tabs like the creative menu to switch between them. probably something for 0.1.4 or 0.1.5
