This is a complete rewrite of the origins mod. Credit to Apace for the original mod, true legend. Thank you for your hard work. This code is entirely different from the original Origins Mod and does not include the functionality of custom origins(yet?)


After the full release, more origins will be added. The plugin is still in early beta, so some functionalities are still not working yet. This plugin is 100% open source for all of its versions. This plugin aims to add plugin support to SpigotMC and all forks of that in an extremely detailed an efficient way. If you are wanting the customization of origins like an easy drop in datapack, this plugin currently does not support that. However, if you do want that, I suggest you check out the Origins-Bukkit plugin. This plugin is only for the purpose of an easy drop in plugin for spigot servers without the need of libraries and other external features. This plugin also plans to be fully compatible with tons of other plugins. 

There are currently 18 origins in the main plugin. More origins will be added in the future with the option to disable those specific origins. 

This plugin runs on a custom API that is built into the plugin to make things more detailed and efficient. It also has normally quick support and moderation. The updates for the plugin are frequent and the updates are made to the quality of which is completed to the best of my abilities at that time. They will always be updated as I learn more. Bug fixes also come frequently. Its also a big priority of mine to give the most quality and customization to the plugin without everything being too complicated. 

## Disclaimer 

If you are wanting to make your own origin and use it for your server, this plugin does not offer that. This plugin is only code driven. This will not be able to work with Bukkit!!
